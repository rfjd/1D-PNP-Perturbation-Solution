**Aref Hashemi**

A second-order perturbation solution to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for ac potentials. The second-order term provides an approximation for the **AREF** between parallel electrodes.  

This program is written in python.  
The packages matplotlib and pylatexenc are required.  

Please follow the steps below to install the packages:  
       1) sudo apt-get install python3-pip  
       2) pip3 install matplotlib  
       3) pip3 install pylatexenc

Alternatively, you can use an integrated development environment (IDE, e.g., pycharm) for installations.

Run the program by python3 AREF_CALC.py.
See Inputs.txt and AREF_CALC.py for details.
